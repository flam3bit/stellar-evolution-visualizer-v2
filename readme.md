Use
-----
In the main menu, there are seven stars, each star being one of each spectral class at the onset of main sequence.
<br>Clicking one star and then pressing the "START" button starts the visualizer.
<br>On the bottom right, there are two options: The first lets you import a star for visualization in the visualizer
<br>The second gives you the option to skip the main sequence.  
**NOTE:** If the star you imported doesn't have a post-main sequence, the "START" button will remain grayed out.
